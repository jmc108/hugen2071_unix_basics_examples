You found the correct door.
Now, this directory contains your prize, a lost sacred manuscript, the scroll (text file) ran.txt.
Try reading the scroll (viewing the contents of the text file).

You find that the scroll has been used as a palimpsest - the original text has been scraped off and written over by a different scribe.

After scrutinizing the scroll, you can faintly distinguish some of the old text between the lines, and you see that some of the lines contain symbols from a more modern alphabet.

You decide to remove the lines containing the following characters:
	a b ! & e f Q S % |
(Be careful, as some of these symbols have special meanings in the context of regular expressions.)

Keep the desired lines and transcribe them out to a new scroll (text file) called nggyu.txt .
Now read the transcribed scroll nggyu.txt (you may wish to zoom out by using holding down the command key and pressing the "minus sign" key a few times).
